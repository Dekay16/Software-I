This is a Windows Form that tracks inventory for a mdae up company(s). It is not connected to any sort of database. The data is added manually in the program and uses a Data Grid View to display the data.
The project will display 2 DGV's that show parts and products that the parts are used to create. When you click a part in the DGV you can update and delete that part, or you can choose to add a new part
entirely. Same goes for the Product's DGV. When adding a part you can add either a inhouse part or an outsourced part depending on if the fictional company is purchasing the part from another company. There
is exceptions in place to make sure you do not delete a product that has any parts tied to the product you are trying to remove.
